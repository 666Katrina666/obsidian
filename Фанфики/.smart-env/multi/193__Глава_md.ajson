Но цена высока: боль оседает в нём, накапливаясь, как яд.#Акт 2: Накопление боли": {"path":null,"embeddings":{"TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2":{"vec":[0.00304475,-0.02824276,-0.01800574,0.02365938,0.0269752,0.00611134,-0.02636329,0.05918914,0.03816552,0.01478228,-0.08208622,-0.04163896,0.04200846,0.00665146,0.00098474,-0.00603723,-0.01696993,0.03450103,-0.13280152,-0.03989688,0.1370935,-0.04867773,0.09091367,-0.07549258,-0.01500286,0.04479189,-0.05352293,-0.03943261,0.0140012,-0.18445507,-0.00780449,-0.02332548,0.0890962,-0.03096069,0.05182707,-0.02345683,-0.07325131,-0.00502174,-0.07298729,0.06630529,0.02561039,-0.00458134,-0.02751178,-0.04216518,0.00861963,-0.00628337,-0.02753417,-0.00585732,-0.02738581,-0.05789527,-0.07342009,0.00373512,-0.0394011,0.0599744,0.04490335,-0.02959573,0.04369989,0.01024205,0.00862856,-0.00584356,0.03873355,-0.00643731,-0.23171496,0.02676202,-0.01787337,0.01619494,-0.01027632,-0.01614301,0.0771503,-0.0131982,-0.01800284,0.03768564,-0.04097278,0.00035123,0.01512544,-0.04500235,-0.04219937,-0.02764959,-0.0645882,0.00081909,0.08288798,0.04340383,-0.0168559,-0.03920028,-0.00087151,-0.07124491,0.00315018,-0.03618633,0.00434718,0.01066874,0.00350692,-0.00625798,0.02008152,0.03032974,-0.03726251,-0.01130679,0.04139111,0.06023257,-0.03841898,0.08862617,-0.04613897,0.04343965,0.01812507,0.0317067,0.00214032,-0.00452953,-0.00011938,-0.00539471,-0.02357999,-0.03217551,-0.04269877,-0.0571571,0.07658336,-0.00576486,0.00868317,0.03940029,0.05015365,0.03058792,-0.03651021,0.01992502,0.10118153,0.00235711,0.02446256,0.06158439,0.09355301,-0.01552618,-0.01855283,0.05394268,0.01564639,0.04395979,0.0829623,0.0574519,-0.04387125,-0.0547814,-0.01798898,-0.01357003,-0.04136268,0.09454863,-0.01525826,-0.03019086,-0.00630604,-0.09247763,-0.00804502,-0.03773426,-0.06634804,0.15844019,-0.03634212,0.05286601,-0.03857277,0.01312515,-0.0103093,0.05686519,-0.05974247,-0.03146548,-0.00948304,0.00772857,0.01508302,0.13430111,-0.08139913,-0.00348765,-0.04150416,0.017358,-0.0243434,0.09163511,-0.03504295,-0.0043811,-0.02563074,0.03693614,0.05604482,-0.08225635,0.04490213,-0.00534311,-0.00790171,0.03040062,0.03644102,-0.0279303,0.04500341,-0.05715849,0.00908491,-0.00718573,0.03781284,-0.01058543,-0.06934129,0.03965003,0.02130882,-0.04573429,-0.0339138,-0.02706421,0.03564024,0.04087343,-0.10386915,0.01421321,-0.00920842,0.00426801,-0.02688795,-0.01192354,-0.01345264,0.00912758,0.04542713,-0.05080488,0.08280849,0.00552854,-0.00832176,0.03240301,0.00957259,0.07524773,0.02901124,-0.0440455,0.05287125,0.01303378,-0.04691381,-0.02018007,0.01172411,0.01049175,0.01715484,0.03784269,-0.05405422,0.02091532,-0.02293567,0.02092034,0.07194246,-0.03516736,-0.09853544,-0.19546899,0.00087851,-0.0191456,-0.00554281,0.03197405,-0.07087689,0.08966304,-0.00181721,0.04101773,0.0938243,0.06899986,0.04263546,-0.10785851,0.03926753,-0.01743952,0.01949348,-0.01948283,0.00965923,-0.04037203,0.03692535,-0.0218617,0.02499114,-0.02051818,0.01981216,0.05116554,-0.01395571,0.10365066,0.0433072,-0.04020814,-0.02353213,0.0367609,0.05303244,-0.05210173,-0.0546421,0.09829108,-0.01885694,-0.00593414,0.02775751,0.00210519,0.02494717,0.06025735,0.08188828,0.00827593,0.02221223,-0.00070186,-0.03192331,-0.02618095,-0.05347974,-0.06046236,0.02304659,-0.00055511,0.02847815,0.04818207,-0.02129348,0.04643657,0.00169812,-0.08640138,-0.03858931,-0.03271658,0.02218158,-0.07381237,0.00271703,0.00977046,-0.06306043,0.01179364,-0.03434727,-0.05934152,0.0446041,-0.0513039,0.00841466,-0.01849367,0.11738572,-0.01856766,-0.01131589,0.05144484,0.02565604,0.043756,0.05283112,0.01154259,-0.07216764,0.02857496,0.02039944,-0.0341519,0.02384129,0.0513682,0.00412136,0.09277172,0.01237898,0.03714051,0.02562451,-0.05564,-0.06575792,0.006161,-0.0509505,0.039087,0.02504216,-0.29755527,0.00940584,-0.00933379,0.01151855,0.0141909,0.01323611,0.05453461,0.02231025,-0.05007131,0.00007352,0.00336511,0.03904897,0.01027172,0.02464229,-0.02069828,-0.06948671,-0.01517629,-0.05829915,0.08087204,-0.01381818,-0.02981356,-0.01191791,0.17365807,0.02143729,-0.0243414,-0.01290094,-0.00962694,0.06589101,0.03457331,-0.00145348,-0.00044696,-0.03934275,0.08907881,-0.00315429,-0.01219628,0.08156994,-0.0388647,0.04711135,-0.01554132,-0.0269045,-0.04642487,0.0342897,-0.00930462,0.031673,0.08416963,-0.01260664,-0.03615897,-0.04933795,-0.045422,-0.04402165,0.0442171,0.02676327,0.02397216,0.01673835,0.03460655,0.02879254,-0.01345849,-0.02507972,0.01936349,-0.03591771,-0.05083711,-0.02937337,-0.06108228,0.06194595,0.04340101],"last_embed":{"hash":"1vu101x","tokens":457}}},"text":null,"length":0,"last_read":{"hash":"1vu101x","at":1760997277753},"key":"193.

Но цена высока: боль оседает в нём, накапливаясь, как яд.#Эпилог: Новый Красный Капюшон": {"path":null,"embeddings":{"TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2":{"vec":[0.00218916,-0.02782935,-0.01697828,0.02322504,0.02612647,0.00450209,-0.02632243,0.05803503,0.0375287,0.01498808,-0.08322001,-0.04359123,0.0405663,0.00922431,0.00075879,-0.00727561,-0.01582798,0.03563055,-0.13370259,-0.03845138,0.13820235,-0.04912543,0.09010471,-0.07518519,-0.01511978,0.04492697,-0.05147309,-0.03936263,0.01217771,-0.18476641,-0.00806529,-0.02414875,0.09016655,-0.03148507,0.05023104,-0.02158867,-0.07375319,-0.00459794,-0.07454222,0.06575414,0.02556557,-0.00416676,-0.03063248,-0.04285838,0.00734686,-0.00706781,-0.02539235,-0.0079957,-0.02903859,-0.05889868,-0.07392839,0.00374158,-0.0389814,0.06037992,0.0452848,-0.02928988,0.04302099,0.01246536,0.00782291,-0.00910407,0.03851113,-0.00796217,-0.23187341,0.02644128,-0.01653879,0.01464506,-0.01055924,-0.01659226,0.07687569,-0.01327666,-0.01804887,0.03541959,-0.04154656,0.00177187,0.01574086,-0.04376359,-0.0431341,-0.02773747,-0.06472094,-0.00138402,0.08492178,0.04174858,-0.01504386,-0.0387883,0.00129605,-0.07037502,0.004577,-0.03508435,0.00581377,0.01202314,0.00520938,-0.00830557,0.02186388,0.03049787,-0.03569071,-0.0122452,0.04105971,0.0604232,-0.03865398,0.08789748,-0.04522553,0.04342623,0.02119552,0.03131454,0.00413674,-0.00553392,-0.00002683,-0.00471872,-0.02561063,-0.03326873,-0.044126,-0.05725454,0.07656447,-0.00403435,0.01001672,0.03942874,0.05038585,0.03115477,-0.03647894,0.01960342,0.1019683,0.0010123,0.02563017,0.06020312,0.0940791,-0.01470369,-0.01898687,0.0531592,0.01531609,0.04340953,0.08385235,0.05709974,-0.04214501,-0.05425747,-0.0194269,-0.01405416,-0.04034323,0.09416926,-0.01564302,-0.03254561,-0.00456871,-0.09199977,-0.00824322,-0.03819728,-0.06641457,0.15721971,-0.03796535,0.05442016,-0.03907366,0.01368707,-0.00906664,0.05616286,-0.05947214,-0.03154731,-0.01068952,0.00828669,0.0151058,0.13376984,-0.08036361,-0.00618813,-0.04077275,0.01563964,-0.02759199,0.09158107,-0.03473669,-0.00466276,-0.02636641,0.03818717,0.05526761,-0.08326047,0.04498123,-0.00577567,-0.00676431,0.02992488,0.03569435,-0.02616547,0.04635339,-0.05876403,0.00915084,-0.0073479,0.0386629,-0.01131405,-0.0722559,0.03887381,0.02153671,-0.04713112,-0.03322781,-0.02728505,0.03630334,0.0434492,-0.10253341,0.01259159,-0.0100328,0.00336355,-0.02646952,-0.00899222,-0.01299369,0.0076379,0.04391272,-0.04998947,0.08379281,0.00390553,-0.00899507,0.03259081,0.01032717,0.07712052,0.02791474,-0.044833,0.0538091,0.01195438,-0.04657954,-0.02000632,0.01285976,0.01317978,0.01788371,0.03800584,-0.05335392,0.01877365,-0.02237579,0.02313136,0.07050713,-0.03739323,-0.09888184,-0.19463967,-0.00070114,-0.01824686,-0.00581872,0.03365586,-0.07059047,0.08941194,-0.00114236,0.04058625,0.0925902,0.06963146,0.04544206,-0.10724133,0.03975143,-0.0173517,0.01918031,-0.01808847,0.00907347,-0.03972178,0.03627805,-0.02232094,0.02532629,-0.01803212,0.01792543,0.04970405,-0.01593029,0.10391222,0.04248744,-0.03861699,-0.02435762,0.03740413,0.05213998,-0.05219863,-0.05208134,0.09924222,-0.01668318,-0.00611359,0.02761006,0.00210973,0.02476848,0.05954603,0.08232702,0.00856615,0.02022488,0.00118597,-0.03086147,-0.02556582,-0.0511007,-0.05892546,0.02522102,0.00134036,0.02847157,0.04839581,-0.01924381,0.046563,0.00296887,-0.08707345,-0.03833233,-0.03320079,0.0228729,-0.07442916,0.00181284,0.00869957,-0.06283758,0.01115525,-0.03387266,-0.05878884,0.04437048,-0.05097146,0.00637558,-0.01839318,0.11793418,-0.0213507,-0.01211953,0.04910174,0.02411178,0.0425554,0.05380045,0.01142957,-0.07259949,0.0268258,0.0216069,-0.03474708,0.0220853,0.05083743,0.0038627,0.09269219,0.0125943,0.03899234,0.02553561,-0.0544649,-0.06764683,0.00750759,-0.04829136,0.04155099,0.02502714,-0.29818001,0.00951267,-0.01135949,0.01145441,0.0152465,0.01372256,0.05359573,0.02174636,-0.04760174,0.00008797,0.00339015,0.03722173,0.01073614,0.02518087,-0.02143069,-0.07023111,-0.01417959,-0.05689403,0.08040308,-0.01204289,-0.03076211,-0.01169303,0.17428599,0.02169935,-0.0251684,-0.01408408,-0.01026401,0.06747299,0.03578673,-0.00059401,-0.00244942,-0.03917396,0.08857436,-0.00498963,-0.01233434,0.08240044,-0.03777969,0.04554608,-0.01607549,-0.0271379,-0.04691738,0.03521382,-0.00882598,0.03242907,0.08455908,-0.01260892,-0.03522146,-0.04929646,-0.04385855,-0.04258795,0.04518481,0.02627284,0.02474625,0.01678279,0.03430425,0.02760754,-0.01269526,-0.02512002,0.01662273,-0.03672501,-0.05005637,-0.02987605,-0.05996923,0.06214318,0.04301192],"last_embed":{"hash":"1efa3c6","tokens":466}}},"text":null,"length":0,"last_read":{"hash":"1efa3c6","at":1760997278129},"key":"193.

Но цена высока: боль оседает в нём, накапливаясь, как яд.#Эпилог: Новый Красный Капюшон#{1}": {"path":null,"embeddings":{"TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2":{"vec":[0.00226939,-0.02797408,-0.01717094,0.02341701,0.0261856,0.00385077,-0.02614639,0.05840784,0.03760291,0.01504901,-0.08295035,-0.04346796,0.04051932,0.00869878,0.00080811,-0.00719402,-0.01567369,0.03558952,-0.13421249,-0.03862382,0.13778192,-0.04936429,0.08981857,-0.07497288,-0.01486954,0.04485458,-0.05157198,-0.03921214,0.01225679,-0.1846015,-0.0082242,-0.02415335,0.09012964,-0.03140864,0.05019859,-0.02153338,-0.07374453,-0.00453533,-0.07443924,0.06566198,0.02570609,-0.00422157,-0.03045774,-0.04289884,0.00724613,-0.0068092,-0.02547608,-0.00785565,-0.02859005,-0.05841105,-0.07408042,0.00379362,-0.03916137,0.06025847,0.04539875,-0.0290359,0.04314553,0.01208076,0.00753649,-0.00914598,0.03850441,-0.00805449,-0.2320137,0.02628235,-0.0167234,0.01530173,-0.01020778,-0.01655541,0.07681774,-0.0134557,-0.01810147,0.0355894,-0.04173527,0.00172376,0.01551513,-0.04412267,-0.0432163,-0.02764233,-0.06508114,-0.00081599,0.0849323,0.04190946,-0.01552003,-0.03868565,0.00093583,-0.07006131,0.00429143,-0.03537891,0.00601143,0.01178918,0.00508041,-0.00822384,0.02178974,0.03049469,-0.03581828,-0.0120001,0.04135618,0.06045767,-0.03880172,0.08779842,-0.04545364,0.0433176,0.02076178,0.03117199,0.00380056,-0.00564711,-0.00029569,-0.00499995,-0.02540032,-0.03346035,-0.04410367,-0.05739996,0.07662871,-0.00407449,0.00950745,0.03976109,0.05045284,0.03138008,-0.03670639,0.01936505,0.10204285,0.00105323,0.02553851,0.06010475,0.09423026,-0.01502477,-0.01893363,0.0532737,0.01561015,0.04364096,0.08373614,0.05704926,-0.04257195,-0.05446539,-0.019251,-0.01411762,-0.04058943,0.09418842,-0.01580177,-0.0325884,-0.00469869,-0.09240957,-0.00852353,-0.0378003,-0.0661661,0.15725696,-0.03805193,0.05403895,-0.03910589,0.01367989,-0.0090999,0.05617716,-0.05928851,-0.03131456,-0.01065409,0.00785818,0.01510241,0.13387558,-0.08043118,-0.00605721,-0.0412568,0.0158009,-0.02735528,0.09122178,-0.03499854,-0.00458957,-0.02636271,0.03791242,0.05578177,-0.08300091,0.04517915,-0.00574608,-0.00681366,0.03021684,0.03553285,-0.0263568,0.04641304,-0.05844131,0.0091024,-0.0073592,0.03835547,-0.01117434,-0.07207459,0.03868219,0.02180384,-0.04744849,-0.03304533,-0.02767679,0.03652854,0.04322195,-0.10272273,0.01315074,-0.0097734,0.00346117,-0.02656986,-0.00924368,-0.01325141,0.00764742,0.04460536,-0.05026929,0.0836127,0.00410723,-0.00875881,0.03255301,0.00977062,0.07704721,0.02796421,-0.04454087,0.0537289,0.01212071,-0.04606452,-0.02016274,0.01274763,0.0130471,0.01819106,0.03836039,-0.05345253,0.01872389,-0.0228031,0.02334157,0.07043125,-0.03688974,-0.09889911,-0.19441462,-0.00019117,-0.01846709,-0.00569591,0.0334753,-0.0708525,0.08958018,-0.00095208,0.04074786,0.09268527,0.06945045,0.04519947,-0.10730379,0.03970883,-0.01712656,0.01939339,-0.01822546,0.00914223,-0.03988348,0.03594866,-0.02231174,0.02542062,-0.0182711,0.01799943,0.04968438,-0.01599115,0.10340579,0.04284543,-0.0380823,-0.02429451,0.03736291,0.05180486,-0.05229758,-0.05203646,0.09956913,-0.01648177,-0.00667435,0.02723719,0.00258636,0.02487601,0.05957464,0.08240922,0.00869217,0.02040162,0.00131745,-0.0309149,-0.02552845,-0.05125276,-0.05900168,0.02514145,0.00099911,0.02851075,0.04810496,-0.01950905,0.04712909,0.0027782,-0.08711167,-0.03808044,-0.03277397,0.02267606,-0.07430994,0.00193172,0.0085675,-0.06265212,0.01100629,-0.03411702,-0.05883176,0.04424942,-0.05093938,0.00641142,-0.01854338,0.11811285,-0.02095716,-0.01197428,0.04955675,0.02423315,0.04306271,0.05393255,0.01166127,-0.07226952,0.02700099,0.02148087,-0.03482975,0.02198134,0.05065739,0.00387486,0.09261958,0.01288641,0.03898416,0.02583427,-0.05507201,-0.06712234,0.00718795,-0.04830135,0.04162739,0.02534375,-0.29782188,0.0097859,-0.01133866,0.01165797,0.01533177,0.01384262,0.05372563,0.02136365,-0.04790723,-0.00000643,0.00341845,0.03728566,0.01119406,0.02529202,-0.02149508,-0.07043684,-0.01424225,-0.05670893,0.08045598,-0.0121826,-0.03058549,-0.01181422,0.17433035,0.02171362,-0.02510929,-0.01394212,-0.01047004,0.06709117,0.03542231,-0.00070373,-0.00215748,-0.03909132,0.08880512,-0.00526045,-0.01225881,0.08281901,-0.03742541,0.04572312,-0.01624336,-0.02731499,-0.04685355,0.03527023,-0.0089506,0.03222439,0.08419986,-0.01252114,-0.03527706,-0.04943758,-0.04412398,-0.04250798,0.04517734,0.02621603,0.02439472,0.01666304,0.03463249,0.02783845,-0.0126198,-0.02467148,0.01661942,-0.03674081,-0.05010836,-0.02997111,-0.06011866,0.06204132,0.0429733],"last_embed":{"hash":"bsyyod","tokens":465}}},"text":null,"length":0,"last_read":{"hash":"bsyyod","at":1760997278174},"key":"193. Глава.md#193. Джейсон Тодд, скрывающийся под личиной Красного Капюшона, действует в Готэме как магический боец. Его обычная форма — привычный антигерой в кожаной куртке и шлеме, но магическая ипостась — маленький мальчик с недетскими глазами, сохраняющий разум и воспоминания взрослого Джейсона. Никто в Бэтсемье или Готэме не знает, что Красный Капюшон — это он. Он избегает близких, боясь раскрыть себя. Его магия уникальна: он впитывает боль и страдания тех, кого спасает. Каждая спасённая жизнь, каждая поглощённая рана делает его сильнее — физически, магически, эмоционально. Переломы заживают мгновенно, пули не оставляют следов, удары становятся сокрушительными.

Но цена высока: боль оседает в нём, накапливаясь, как яд.#Акт 2: Накопление боли": {"path":null,"embeddings":{"TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2":{"vec":[0.00306938,-0.02912662,-0.01859914,0.02332936,0.02809282,0.00704756,-0.02581383,0.0586494,0.03799224,0.01419101,-0.0814188,-0.04146223,0.04103846,0.00858375,-0.00013238,-0.00770077,-0.01645393,0.03396173,-0.13296144,-0.04005947,0.13532116,-0.04967444,0.09109436,-0.0763535,-0.01609416,0.04561342,-0.05411511,-0.04066108,0.01414618,-0.18388788,-0.00728504,-0.02291597,0.08856238,-0.03228137,0.05150381,-0.02342536,-0.07370109,-0.0048247,-0.07281505,0.06639412,0.02474891,-0.00381964,-0.02934465,-0.04180925,0.00773173,-0.00607775,-0.02776796,-0.00618751,-0.02813601,-0.05810685,-0.07270559,0.00420084,-0.03964494,0.05881307,0.04363614,-0.03045268,0.04411879,0.01187347,0.00934435,-0.00670075,0.0386121,-0.00815058,-0.23070884,0.0277237,-0.01821076,0.01657875,-0.00968194,-0.01612182,0.07690954,-0.01371571,-0.01663281,0.03685174,-0.04072752,-0.00006836,0.01536206,-0.04432328,-0.04358027,-0.02610396,-0.06483293,-0.00057185,0.08441103,0.04225935,-0.01698266,-0.03716401,-0.00008419,-0.07121439,0.00375406,-0.03583176,0.0045747,0.01131908,0.00496441,-0.00670634,0.02137848,0.03058527,-0.0363536,-0.01209692,0.04200934,0.06074803,-0.03835576,0.08837932,-0.04592959,0.04344936,0.01960842,0.03281762,0.00166179,-0.00540652,0.00014615,-0.00536392,-0.02426363,-0.03328089,-0.04268871,-0.05706533,0.07742542,-0.00562404,0.00837072,0.03860084,0.04970445,0.03141263,-0.03715967,0.01899195,0.10074184,0.00280967,0.02459781,0.06141104,0.09308722,-0.0150836,-0.01974686,0.05256586,0.01478324,0.04603385,0.08406239,0.05655851,-0.04276676,-0.05435896,-0.01814815,-0.01279802,-0.04042188,0.09436538,-0.01751328,-0.03073942,-0.00585429,-0.09252781,-0.00704853,-0.03716823,-0.06642208,0.15673015,-0.03698446,0.05320338,-0.03932882,0.01368166,-0.01008061,0.05620499,-0.05948589,-0.03167714,-0.01022588,0.0070752,0.0153448,0.13402739,-0.08041988,-0.00410091,-0.04150634,0.01704703,-0.02582026,0.09085092,-0.03648008,-0.00574984,-0.02577955,0.0377312,0.05527878,-0.08116645,0.04424823,-0.00594936,-0.00843485,0.03042584,0.03681724,-0.02570491,0.04567687,-0.05648292,0.01058513,-0.00738623,0.03899308,-0.01064152,-0.07135334,0.03847362,0.02098006,-0.04656189,-0.03429057,-0.02796752,0.03658017,0.04107475,-0.10471715,0.01348738,-0.01102772,0.00423455,-0.02654426,-0.00908551,-0.01380336,0.00781918,0.04542222,-0.04979132,0.08312242,0.0051616,-0.00768347,0.03210909,0.01012797,0.07582906,0.02954577,-0.045009,0.05280129,0.01328844,-0.04679523,-0.01928507,0.01173238,0.01085226,0.01672432,0.03871403,-0.05477184,0.02140017,-0.02270428,0.02173951,0.07278937,-0.03622746,-0.09742387,-0.19564511,0.00113377,-0.02055874,-0.00532833,0.03304575,-0.07029328,0.09014211,-0.00056386,0.03995983,0.09545244,0.0688647,0.04442558,-0.10543923,0.03852964,-0.01683653,0.0201449,-0.01885607,0.01071257,-0.04211479,0.03661253,-0.02275356,0.02362152,-0.02057735,0.01939432,0.05096418,-0.0140686,0.10363495,0.04364748,-0.03773655,-0.02506373,0.03780164,0.05270709,-0.0515973,-0.05523333,0.10021487,-0.01757527,-0.00560294,0.02685144,0.00304993,0.02326769,0.06065377,0.08112744,0.00739672,0.02084889,-0.00023341,-0.03156965,-0.02601057,-0.05262702,-0.06014583,0.02361874,0.00169611,0.02920123,0.04846603,-0.02000797,0.04754232,0.00243456,-0.08709512,-0.03786353,-0.03163063,0.02312746,-0.0745112,0.00386682,0.00887686,-0.06146064,0.01284186,-0.03262137,-0.06014216,0.04415934,-0.05102326,0.00701946,-0.01957499,0.11735516,-0.01999427,-0.01072525,0.0507561,0.02517557,0.04375889,0.05365577,0.01277229,-0.07320134,0.02759264,0.01861172,-0.03380825,0.02271471,0.0508621,0.00363015,0.09325162,0.01344482,0.03721907,0.02639793,-0.05596133,-0.06562627,0.00610495,-0.05246649,0.04184911,0.02587858,-0.29732534,0.00859239,-0.01001395,0.01221673,0.01480738,0.01452416,0.05523353,0.02135097,-0.04907113,-0.00115028,0.00275912,0.03841224,0.01004068,0.02485741,-0.02177952,-0.06970985,-0.01576122,-0.0594934,0.080918,-0.01249645,-0.03050865,-0.01192818,0.17431635,0.0209138,-0.02298214,-0.0144235,-0.01004256,0.06531636,0.03336879,-0.00039193,-0.00318657,-0.0388046,0.08844294,-0.00446187,-0.01375168,0.08155789,-0.03781738,0.04698806,-0.01653662,-0.02796556,-0.04617792,0.03407204,-0.00849186,0.03239604,0.08443351,-0.01204806,-0.03659304,-0.05047039,-0.04550137,-0.04463128,0.04501595,0.02666607,0.02526668,0.01636478,0.03498297,0.02871948,-0.01199189,-0.02496564,0.01883131,-0.03710976,-0.05017575,-0.03020617,-0.06109622,0.06177044,0.04408569],"last_embed":{"hash":"1mqxxv0","tokens":455}}},"text":null,"length":0,"last_read":{"hash":"1mqxxv0","at":1761128558299},"key":"193.

Но цена высока: боль оседает в нём, накапливаясь, как яд.#Эпилог: Новый Красный Капюшон": {"path":null,"embeddings":{"TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2":{"vec":[0.00141686,-0.0284504,-0.01641114,0.02271874,0.0269114,0.00389576,-0.02546559,0.05925374,0.03776789,0.01494169,-0.08285007,-0.04295634,0.04010152,0.00842382,0.00162036,-0.00633704,-0.01612115,0.03482622,-0.13425581,-0.03859517,0.13817684,-0.0493568,0.08996411,-0.07401478,-0.01416223,0.04416374,-0.05174437,-0.03969998,0.01244195,-0.18486241,-0.00849814,-0.02344362,0.09056149,-0.03052472,0.04967522,-0.02193776,-0.07339371,-0.0037068,-0.07442262,0.06558203,0.02648223,-0.00352114,-0.03021337,-0.04293353,0.00752163,-0.00611023,-0.02539204,-0.00687818,-0.02795453,-0.05842413,-0.07372119,0.00362814,-0.0391519,0.05864726,0.04600583,-0.02792758,0.0428775,0.0110782,0.00724492,-0.00899987,0.03805342,-0.00812664,-0.23226285,0.02643294,-0.01664041,0.01509587,-0.01063905,-0.01733502,0.0762265,-0.01377835,-0.0181639,0.03573948,-0.04157351,0.00202206,0.01510246,-0.04417817,-0.0427815,-0.02825368,-0.06537171,0.00092316,0.08489905,0.04203216,-0.01520009,-0.03903327,-0.0002386,-0.06980875,0.00418081,-0.03486307,0.00632596,0.0110698,0.00419584,-0.00728752,0.02117,0.03061943,-0.03530813,-0.01140949,0.04263387,0.06022927,-0.03919219,0.08790188,-0.04599765,0.04275383,0.01990406,0.03128258,0.00416156,-0.00527431,-0.00005337,-0.00520029,-0.0257011,-0.03373497,-0.04432737,-0.05674125,0.0761771,-0.00430413,0.01004975,0.04048347,0.05032339,0.03166809,-0.03680288,0.01907979,0.10182898,0.00118963,0.02541111,0.06009107,0.0944401,-0.01523303,-0.01781546,0.05340205,0.01612329,0.04333144,0.08379091,0.05674591,-0.04350157,-0.05452923,-0.01967707,-0.01484272,-0.04035639,0.09383699,-0.01571782,-0.03243901,-0.00576698,-0.09192286,-0.00911155,-0.0381428,-0.06615693,0.1579067,-0.03822347,0.05388074,-0.03892691,0.01338874,-0.00989126,0.05682052,-0.06014311,-0.03094612,-0.010144,0.00743893,0.01552938,0.13397789,-0.08088555,-0.00543062,-0.04202831,0.01625104,-0.0271716,0.08990874,-0.03581717,-0.00449664,-0.0270283,0.03754583,0.0561216,-0.0834941,0.04460068,-0.00567388,-0.00693054,0.03047656,0.03598545,-0.0264662,0.04580974,-0.05845814,0.00872823,-0.0071134,0.03692329,-0.01099272,-0.07151886,0.03799255,0.02151586,-0.04729308,-0.03208168,-0.02730365,0.03653278,0.04239129,-0.10398767,0.01260563,-0.00933479,0.00417036,-0.02702255,-0.0098349,-0.01310118,0.0084264,0.04538149,-0.05068713,0.08328177,0.00503312,-0.00874616,0.03309204,0.00994841,0.07699233,0.02725744,-0.04434299,0.0541086,0.01244041,-0.04576511,-0.02081048,0.01251372,0.01274297,0.01846723,0.03809347,-0.05355345,0.01919046,-0.02327655,0.02354245,0.07119695,-0.03691495,-0.09881186,-0.19450724,0.00039465,-0.01818436,-0.00591214,0.03333912,-0.07080355,0.08984903,-0.00078163,0.04134662,0.09374567,0.06872761,0.04516603,-0.10803267,0.0399733,-0.01693019,0.01847374,-0.01857253,0.00899672,-0.04031464,0.0347233,-0.02264432,0.02502047,-0.01893409,0.01836999,0.04979084,-0.01618038,0.10397716,0.04390872,-0.03841862,-0.0235629,0.03659227,0.05170461,-0.05203887,-0.05233723,0.09948996,-0.01684031,-0.00649512,0.02636149,0.00200741,0.02454434,0.05960094,0.08233638,0.0092248,0.01929981,0.00117594,-0.03094463,-0.0251459,-0.05122013,-0.05878824,0.02505899,0.00062261,0.02814973,0.04789554,-0.01932677,0.04738806,0.00299528,-0.08645319,-0.0369411,-0.0327995,0.0223731,-0.07349633,0.00213142,0.00918578,-0.0632529,0.01004279,-0.03475001,-0.05910816,0.0438187,-0.05108418,0.00654954,-0.01791855,0.11839145,-0.01961303,-0.01192258,0.05024328,0.02359279,0.04419298,0.05304057,0.01160115,-0.07177322,0.0274511,0.02201129,-0.03417891,0.02205864,0.05102008,0.00436464,0.09303585,0.01232642,0.03945018,0.02521131,-0.05495099,-0.0659371,0.0071159,-0.04835577,0.04057517,0.0252852,-0.2977089,0.01041479,-0.01065133,0.01184352,0.01530417,0.0135548,0.05416336,0.02209919,-0.04786361,0.00013211,0.00367199,0.03776781,0.010847,0.02464334,-0.02126836,-0.07071101,-0.01461948,-0.05627315,0.08033656,-0.01243644,-0.03058503,-0.01260464,0.17480706,0.02187366,-0.02489498,-0.013218,-0.0111084,0.06676106,0.03560891,-0.00194658,-0.00179022,-0.03882856,0.0892251,-0.00548252,-0.01297402,0.08314694,-0.03729482,0.04631387,-0.01609868,-0.02784203,-0.04663778,0.03548866,-0.00944436,0.03147771,0.083235,-0.01281388,-0.03515299,-0.04924029,-0.04489873,-0.04167478,0.04504044,0.02636983,0.02460789,0.01637797,0.03497347,0.0274148,-0.01300009,-0.02456081,0.01669375,-0.03613778,-0.05018312,-0.02960633,-0.06103111,0.06252553,0.04250108],"last_embed":{"hash":"1f3owgu","tokens":462}}},"text":null,"length":0,"last_read":{"hash":"1f3owgu","at":1761128558680},"key":"193.

Но цена высока: боль оседает в нём, накапливаясь, как яд.#Эпилог: Новый Красный Капюшон#{1}": {"path":null,"embeddings":{"TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2":{"vec":[0.00141686,-0.0284504,-0.01641114,0.02271874,0.0269114,0.00389576,-0.02546559,0.05925374,0.03776789,0.01494169,-0.08285007,-0.04295634,0.04010152,0.00842382,0.00162036,-0.00633704,-0.01612115,0.03482622,-0.13425581,-0.03859517,0.13817684,-0.0493568,0.08996411,-0.07401478,-0.01416223,0.04416374,-0.05174437,-0.03969998,0.01244195,-0.18486241,-0.00849814,-0.02344362,0.09056149,-0.03052472,0.04967522,-0.02193776,-0.07339371,-0.0037068,-0.07442262,0.06558203,0.02648223,-0.00352114,-0.03021337,-0.04293353,0.00752163,-0.00611023,-0.02539204,-0.00687818,-0.02795453,-0.05842413,-0.07372119,0.00362814,-0.0391519,0.05864726,0.04600583,-0.02792758,0.0428775,0.0110782,0.00724492,-0.00899987,0.03805342,-0.00812664,-0.23226285,0.02643294,-0.01664041,0.01509587,-0.01063905,-0.01733502,0.0762265,-0.01377835,-0.0181639,0.03573948,-0.04157351,0.00202206,0.01510246,-0.04417817,-0.0427815,-0.02825368,-0.06537171,0.00092316,0.08489905,0.04203216,-0.01520009,-0.03903327,-0.0002386,-0.06980875,0.00418081,-0.03486307,0.00632596,0.0110698,0.00419584,-0.00728752,0.02117,0.03061943,-0.03530813,-0.01140949,0.04263387,0.06022927,-0.03919219,0.08790188,-0.04599765,0.04275383,0.01990406,0.03128258,0.00416156,-0.00527431,-0.00005337,-0.00520029,-0.0257011,-0.03373497,-0.04432737,-0.05674125,0.0761771,-0.00430413,0.01004975,0.04048347,0.05032339,0.03166809,-0.03680288,0.01907979,0.10182898,0.00118963,0.02541111,0.06009107,0.0944401,-0.01523303,-0.01781546,0.05340205,0.01612329,0.04333144,0.08379091,0.05674591,-0.04350157,-0.05452923,-0.01967707,-0.01484272,-0.04035639,0.09383699,-0.01571782,-0.03243901,-0.00576698,-0.09192286,-0.00911155,-0.0381428,-0.06615693,0.1579067,-0.03822347,0.05388074,-0.03892691,0.01338874,-0.00989126,0.05682052,-0.06014311,-0.03094612,-0.010144,0.00743893,0.01552938,0.13397789,-0.08088555,-0.00543062,-0.04202831,0.01625104,-0.0271716,0.08990874,-0.03581717,-0.00449664,-0.0270283,0.03754583,0.0561216,-0.0834941,0.04460068,-0.00567388,-0.00693054,0.03047656,0.03598545,-0.0264662,0.04580974,-0.05845814,0.00872823,-0.0071134,0.03692329,-0.01099272,-0.07151886,0.03799255,0.02151586,-0.04729308,-0.03208168,-0.02730365,0.03653278,0.04239129,-0.10398767,0.01260563,-0.00933479,0.00417036,-0.02702255,-0.0098349,-0.01310118,0.0084264,0.04538149,-0.05068713,0.08328177,0.00503312,-0.00874616,0.03309204,0.00994841,0.07699233,0.02725744,-0.04434299,0.0541086,0.01244041,-0.04576511,-0.02081048,0.01251372,0.01274297,0.01846723,0.03809347,-0.05355345,0.01919046,-0.02327655,0.02354245,0.07119695,-0.03691495,-0.09881186,-0.19450724,0.00039465,-0.01818436,-0.00591214,0.03333912,-0.07080355,0.08984903,-0.00078163,0.04134662,0.09374567,0.06872761,0.04516603,-0.10803267,0.0399733,-0.01693019,0.01847374,-0.01857253,0.00899672,-0.04031464,0.0347233,-0.02264432,0.02502047,-0.01893409,0.01836999,0.04979084,-0.01618038,0.10397716,0.04390872,-0.03841862,-0.0235629,0.03659227,0.05170461,-0.05203887,-0.05233723,0.09948996,-0.01684031,-0.00649512,0.02636149,0.00200741,0.02454434,0.05960094,0.08233638,0.0092248,0.01929981,0.00117594,-0.03094463,-0.0251459,-0.05122013,-0.05878824,0.02505899,0.00062261,0.02814973,0.04789554,-0.01932677,0.04738806,0.00299528,-0.08645319,-0.0369411,-0.0327995,0.0223731,-0.07349633,0.00213142,0.00918578,-0.0632529,0.01004279,-0.03475001,-0.05910816,0.0438187,-0.05108418,0.00654954,-0.01791855,0.11839145,-0.01961303,-0.01192258,0.05024328,0.02359279,0.04419298,0.05304057,0.01160115,-0.07177322,0.0274511,0.02201129,-0.03417891,0.02205864,0.05102008,0.00436464,0.09303585,0.01232642,0.03945018,0.02521131,-0.05495099,-0.0659371,0.0071159,-0.04835577,0.04057517,0.0252852,-0.2977089,0.01041479,-0.01065133,0.01184352,0.01530417,0.0135548,0.05416336,0.02209919,-0.04786361,0.00013211,0.00367199,0.03776781,0.010847,0.02464334,-0.02126836,-0.07071101,-0.01461948,-0.05627315,0.08033656,-0.01243644,-0.03058503,-0.01260464,0.17480706,0.02187366,-0.02489498,-0.013218,-0.0111084,0.06676106,0.03560891,-0.00194658,-0.00179022,-0.03882856,0.0892251,-0.00548252,-0.01297402,0.08314694,-0.03729482,0.04631387,-0.01609868,-0.02784203,-0.04663778,0.03548866,-0.00944436,0.03147771,0.083235,-0.01281388,-0.03515299,-0.04924029,-0.04489873,-0.04167478,0.04504044,0.02636983,0.02460789,0.01637797,0.03497347,0.0274148,-0.01300009,-0.02456081,0.01669375,-0.03613778,-0.05018312,-0.02960633,-0.06103111,0.06252553,0.04250108],"last_embed":{"hash":"gvpfk9","tokens":462}}},"text":null,"length":0,"last_read":{"hash":"gvpfk9","at":1761128558715},"key":"193. Глава.md#193. Джейсон Тодд, скрывающийся под личиной Красного Капюшона, действует в Готэме как магический боец. Его обычная форма — привычный антигерой в кожаной куртке и шлеме, но магическая ипостась — маленький мальчик с недетскими глазами, сохраняющий разум и воспоминания взрослого Джейсона. Никто в Бэтсемье или Готэме не знает, что Красный Капюшон — это он. Он избегает близких, боясь раскрыть себя. Его магия уникальна: он впитывает боль и страдания тех, кого спасает. Каждая спасённая жизнь, каждая поглощённая рана делает его сильнее — физически, магически, эмоционально. Переломы заживают мгновенно, пули не оставляют следов, удары становятся сокрушительными.

"smart_blocks:193. Глава.md#193. Джейсон Тодд, скрывающийся под личиной Красного Капюшона, действует в Готэме как магический боец. Его обычная форма — привычный антигерой в кожаной куртке и шлеме, но магическая ипостась — маленький мальчик с недетскими глазами, сохраняющий разум и воспоминания взрослого Джейсона. Никто в Бэтсемье или Готэме не знает, что Красный Капюшон — это он. Он избегает близких, боясь раскрыть себя. Его магия уникальна: он впитывает боль и страдания тех, кого спасает. Каждая спасённая жизнь, каждая поглощённая рана делает его сильнее — физически, магически, эмоционально. Переломы заживают мгновенно, пули не оставляют следов, удары становятся сокрушительными.

Но цена высока: боль оседает в нём, накапливаясь, как яд.#Акт 4: Опека семьи#{8}": {"path":null,"embeddings":{"TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2":{"vec":[0.0014774,-0.02859632,-0.01674867,0.02258457,0.0264935,0.00463061,-0.02623187,0.05886862,0.03715442,0.01553939,-0.08462217,-0.04272368,0.04027899,0.00981609,0.00210848,-0.00615777,-0.01596908,0.03506814,-0.13423415,-0.03869266,0.13828492,-0.04873905,0.09019203,-0.07372058,-0.01507776,0.04380549,-0.05159501,-0.03899546,0.01259286,-0.18505129,-0.00811339,-0.02403529,0.09107999,-0.03021824,0.05015588,-0.02204595,-0.07294958,-0.00347491,-0.07474848,0.06465854,0.02622895,-0.00389655,-0.0298092,-0.04306785,0.00795882,-0.00592466,-0.02532016,-0.00700894,-0.02796839,-0.05963468,-0.0731378,0.00432351,-0.03837942,0.05885507,0.04570254,-0.02795224,0.04369448,0.01059401,0.00709435,-0.00941317,0.03792883,-0.00842041,-0.23256528,0.02549173,-0.01725998,0.0147083,-0.01080337,-0.0158364,0.07548557,-0.01414371,-0.01720859,0.03562228,-0.04217433,0.00248625,0.01573172,-0.04315179,-0.04220485,-0.02845142,-0.0653946,0.00040656,0.08424889,0.04235218,-0.01454583,-0.03922175,0.00133467,-0.07014231,0.00434129,-0.03428448,0.00629005,0.01093957,0.00514511,-0.00712958,0.02110996,0.03016135,-0.03445077,-0.01224269,0.04227719,0.0600057,-0.03939737,0.08950298,-0.04471299,0.04312858,0.02020055,0.03176697,0.00419077,-0.00574057,0.0004817,-0.00486991,-0.02553804,-0.03363745,-0.04512093,-0.05683108,0.07632764,-0.00431844,0.00961663,0.04017664,0.05036481,0.03128253,-0.03612915,0.02019909,0.10201235,0.00017611,0.0256697,0.05981083,0.09459835,-0.01517344,-0.01746759,0.05383223,0.01643339,0.04363162,0.08356382,0.05680194,-0.04361416,-0.05484373,-0.01941277,-0.01506417,-0.0409587,0.09362096,-0.01548068,-0.03389899,-0.00541313,-0.09233181,-0.00919685,-0.03785582,-0.06641079,0.15815705,-0.0380928,0.05359132,-0.03842533,0.01379786,-0.00932589,0.05553019,-0.05977092,-0.03212542,-0.01043179,0.00749238,0.01587795,0.13369288,-0.08107121,-0.00573722,-0.04179888,0.01608075,-0.02739401,0.0914304,-0.03452924,-0.00393914,-0.0264934,0.03771304,0.05619551,-0.08407136,0.04474343,-0.00598933,-0.00671662,0.03056704,0.03588371,-0.02709097,0.04484042,-0.05920964,0.0088402,-0.00699169,0.03771708,-0.01225275,-0.0712518,0.03816293,0.02148115,-0.04671988,-0.03284417,-0.02700162,0.03619656,0.04345612,-0.10389411,0.01200889,-0.01001484,0.00321299,-0.02697299,-0.010808,-0.0129444,0.00874236,0.04450338,-0.0508046,0.08380488,0.00487731,-0.00849895,0.03296203,0.00999493,0.07693465,0.02721633,-0.04507306,0.05359923,0.01263997,-0.04625458,-0.02043371,0.01259797,0.01349456,0.01861445,0.03820362,-0.05404748,0.01940963,-0.02255891,0.02372926,0.07056363,-0.03688854,-0.09862865,-0.19496834,-0.0004717,-0.01713567,-0.0065558,0.03330988,-0.07019136,0.0898106,-0.00086171,0.04094075,0.09297691,0.06917519,0.04418922,-0.10817375,0.04042308,-0.01730204,0.01890956,-0.01857271,0.00918556,-0.03982991,0.03506501,-0.02229468,0.02560841,-0.01862776,0.01880882,0.05131041,-0.01586525,0.10504564,0.0435055,-0.03836602,-0.0235009,0.0366323,0.05132954,-0.05215281,-0.05314035,0.09962786,-0.01766735,-0.00647369,0.02701716,0.00191916,0.02436917,0.05916479,0.08179462,0.00895366,0.01974746,0.00122575,-0.03064698,-0.02494475,-0.05202339,-0.05858392,0.0254163,0.0012304,0.02869011,0.0480828,-0.0188445,0.04742409,0.00311787,-0.08658088,-0.03678023,-0.03348994,0.02257793,-0.07291169,0.00145423,0.00924467,-0.06396552,0.01058735,-0.0355855,-0.05930473,0.04343199,-0.05092746,0.00722495,-0.01780093,0.11690498,-0.01987803,-0.01341395,0.04987792,0.02346035,0.04307903,0.05265425,0.01140063,-0.07151143,0.02738752,0.02198793,-0.0336161,0.02255899,0.05105554,0.00367913,0.09332132,0.01210594,0.03833409,0.02412366,-0.05491114,-0.06598568,0.00763136,-0.04871651,0.03973384,0.02396249,-0.29814246,0.0102522,-0.01007311,0.01204596,0.01491305,0.01310786,0.0536295,0.02277182,-0.04746597,0.0009861,0.00378018,0.03803841,0.01032658,0.0245583,-0.02049869,-0.07030643,-0.01443846,-0.05615373,0.08012994,-0.0120742,-0.03064064,-0.01182554,0.17404674,0.02221565,-0.02548759,-0.01304531,-0.00968067,0.06696808,0.03578366,-0.0012192,-0.00112761,-0.03896719,0.08915558,-0.0057868,-0.01231369,0.08235913,-0.03703811,0.04606663,-0.01597907,-0.02809996,-0.04690943,0.03509708,-0.01008354,0.03144627,0.0833692,-0.01294667,-0.03493409,-0.04822066,-0.04568933,-0.04245956,0.04462323,0.02599801,0.02476573,0.01635674,0.03460176,0.02830418,-0.01359224,-0.02498279,0.01651367,-0.03579137,-0.04962435,-0.02976588,-0.0597862,0.06241823,0.04235621],"last_embed":{"hash":"drrd0d","tokens":460}}},"text":null,"length":0,"last_read":{"hash":"drrd0d","at":1761128558578},"key":"193. Глава.md#193. Джейсон Тодд, скрывающийся под личиной Красного Капюшона, действует в Готэме как магический боец. Его обычная форма — привычный антигерой в кожаной куртке и шлеме, но магическая ипостась — маленький мальчик с недетскими глазами, сохраняющий разум и воспоминания взрослого Джейсона. Никто в Бэтсемье или Готэме не знает, что Красный Капюшон — это он. Он избегает близких, боясь раскрыть себя. Его магия уникальна: он впитывает боль и страдания тех, кого спасает.
